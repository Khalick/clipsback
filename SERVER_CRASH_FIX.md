# Server Crash Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. CORS Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Custom headers like `X-Registration-Number`, `X-Filename`, etc. were not allowed by the CORS configuration, causing preflight request failures.

**Fix**: Added the missing headers to the `allowHeaders` array in the CORS configuration:
```javascript
allowHeaders: [
  'Content-Type', 
  'Authorization', 
  'Accept',
  'Origin',
  'X-Requested-With',
  'X-Registration-Number',    // Added
  'X-Filename',              // Added
  'X-Name',                  // Added
  'X-Course',                // Added
  'X-Level-Of-Study',        // Added
  'X-Email'                  // Added
],
```

### 2. Invalid Hono Constructor Configuration
**Problem**: The Hono constructor was using an invalid `parseBody` configuration that doesn't exist in the Hono API.

**Fix**: Simplified the constructor to just `const app = new Hono();`

### 3. Broken SQL Query
**Problem**: The UPDATE query for units endpoint was malformed:
```javascript
'UPDATE units
[unit_name, unit_code, id]
```

**Fix**: Corrected to proper SQL syntax:
```javascript
'UPDATE units SET unit_name=$1, unit_code=$2 WHERE id=$3 RETURNING *'
```

## Server Endpoints Status

### Working Endpoints:
- ✅ `POST /exam-cards/:regNumber` - Binary and multipart uploads
- ✅ `POST /exam-cards/upload` - Binary and multipart uploads with X-Registration-Number header
- ✅ `POST /exam-cards` - File upload and JSON record saving
- ✅ `POST /students` - Student registration with binary photo upload support
- ✅ `GET /api/health` - Health check
- ✅ All existing CRUD endpoints

### Binary Upload Support:
The API now supports binary file uploads for:
- Exam cards via multiple endpoints
- Student photos during registration
- Content-Type headers: `application/octet-stream`, `image/*`, `application/pdf`, etc.

### CORS Fixed:
All custom headers needed for binary uploads are now properly allowed for cross-origin requests from:
- `https://studentportaladmin.netlify.app`
- `https://clipscollegestudentportal.netlify.app`
- Local development origins

## Test Pages Available:
- `/test-binary-upload.html` - Comprehensive upload testing
- `/simple-test.html` - Basic API endpoint testing

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy the fixed code to Vercel
2. Test the CORS fix with the actual frontend
3. Verify binary uploads work end-to-end
